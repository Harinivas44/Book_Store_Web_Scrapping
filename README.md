## 📋 Steps:

1. Data Collection: The Python script navigates through multiple pages, scrapping the data using the BeautifulSoup library. 📊

2. Data Transformation: The scraped data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame, making it easier to work with and analyze. 📈

3. Data Cleaning: The DataFrame is cleaned and processed, with prices being converted from strings to numerical values. Missing values are also addressed. 🧹

4. Data Analysis: The data is analyzed using tools like Seaborn to explore correlations between different attributes. A heatmap is created to visualize these relationships. 🔍
